    <h2> Mai's King Cake Recipe</h2>
    <p> One of my all-time favorite foods from New Orleans is King Cake, especially during Mardi Gras season. It's a delicious cinnamon roll cake with various fillings and topped with icing. Traditionally, a tiny toy baby is hidden inside the cake, and whoever finds it has to buy the next King Cake.
      <br>

    <p> The most popular King Cake in the area is from Dong Phoung, a James Beard-awarded establishment that is famous for its traditional Vietnamese dishes like Pho and Banh mi. Dong Phuong holds a special place in the hearts of New Orleans-East residents. It's where my mother worked as a waitress when she first came to the US, and the food she brought home from the restaurant became a staple in our household and throughout the community. </p>

      <h4> Steps to Make King Cake </h4>
      <p> <strong> Prepare the Dough: </strong></p>
      <ol>
        <li> In a large bowl, combine the warm milk, sugar, and yeast. Let it sit for about 5-10 minutes until it becomes frothy. </li>
        <li> Add the melted butter, beaten egg yolks, flour, salt, nutmeg, and cinnamon. Mix until a dough forms. </li>
        <li> Knead the dough on a lightly floured surface for about 10 minutes until it is smooth and elastic. </li>
        <li> Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1-2 hours, or until it has doubled in size. </li>
      </ol> <br>

      <p> <strong> Prepare the Filling: </strong></p>
      <ol>
        <li> In a bowl, combine the brown sugar and cinnamon. Add the melted butter and mix until it becomes a paste. Optionally, you can add chopped nuts or raisins to the filling. </li>
      </ol> <br>

      <p> <strong> Assemble the Cake: </strong></p>
      <ol>
        <li> Once the dough has risen, punch it down and roll it out into a large rectangle on a lightly floured surface. </li>
        <li> Spread the filling evenly over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges. </li>
        <li> Roll the dough up tightly, starting from one of the long edges, to form a log. </li>
        <li> Bring the ends of the log together to form a ring, pinching the edges together to seal. </li>
        <li> Place the ring on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Cover with a damp cloth and let it rise again for about 30-45 minutes. </li>
      </ol> <br>

      <p> <strong> Bake the Cake: </strong></p>
      <ol>
        <li> Preheat your oven to 375째F (190째C). </li>
        <li> Bake the King Cake for 25-30 minutes, or until it is golden brown. </li>
        <li> Allow the cake to cool on a wire rack. </li>
      </ol> <br>

      <p> <strong> Decorate the Cake: </strong></p>
      <ol>
        <li> In a small bowl, mix the powdered sugar, milk, and vanilla extract to make the icing. It should be thick but pourable. </li>
        <li> Drizzle the icing over the cooled cake. </li>
        <li> Sprinkle the purple, green, and gold colored sugars over the icing in alternating sections. </li>
        <li> Optionally, hide the small plastic baby inside the cake from the bottom before serving. </li>
      </ol> <br>
