      <h2>About the Recipe</h2>
      <p class="description">
        One of my all-time favorite foods from New Orleans is <strong>King Cake</strong>, especially during Mardi Gras
        season. It's a delicious cinnamon roll cake with various fillings and topped with icing. Traditionally, a tiny
        toy baby is hidden inside the cake, and whoever finds it has to buy the next King Cake.
        <br><br>
        One of the most popular King Cakes in the area is from <strong>Dong Phuong</strong>, a James Beard-awarded
        establishment that is famous for its traditional Vietnamese dishes like Pho and Banh Mi. <br><br> Dong Phuong
        holds a special place in the hearts of New Orleans-East residents. It's where my mother worked as a waitress
        when she first came to the US, and the food she brought home from the restaurant became a staple in our
        household and throughout the community.

      <h3>Steps to Make King Cake</h3>
      <p><strong>Prepare the Dough:</strong></p>
      <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine the warm milk, sugar, and yeast. Let it sit for about 5-10 minutes until it becomes
          frothy.</li>
        <li>Add the melted butter, beaten egg yolks, flour, salt, nutmeg, and cinnamon. Mix until a dough forms.</li>
        <li>Knead the dough on a lightly floured surface for about 10 minutes until it is smooth and elastic.</li>
        <li>Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for about
          1-2 hours, or until it has doubled in size.</li>
      </ol>

      <p><strong>Prepare the Filling:</strong></p>
      <ol>
        <li>In a bowl, combine the brown sugar and cinnamon. Add the melted butter and mix until it becomes a paste.
          Optionally, you can add chopped nuts or raisins to the filling.</li>
      </ol>

      <p><strong>Assemble the Cake:</strong></p>
      <ol>
        <li>Once the dough has risen, punch it down and roll it out into a large rectangle on a lightly floured surface.
        </li>
        <li>Spread the filling evenly over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges.</li>
        <li>Roll the dough up tightly, starting from one of the long edges, to form a log.</li>
        <li>Bring the ends of the log together to form a ring, pinching the edges together to seal.</li>
        <li>Place the ring on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Cover with a damp cloth and let it rise again
          for
          about 30-45 minutes.</li>
      </ol>

      <p><strong>Bake the Cake:</strong></p>
      <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 375째F (190째C).</li>
        <li>Bake the King Cake for 25-30 minutes, or until it is golden brown.</li>
        <li>Allow the cake to cool on a wire rack.</li>
      </ol>

      <p><strong>Decorate the Cake:</strong></p>
      <ol>
        <li>In a small bowl, mix the powdered sugar, milk, and vanilla extract to make the icing. It should be thick but
          pourable.</li>
        <li>Drizzle the icing over the cooled cake.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the purple, green, and gold colored sugars over the icing in alternating sections.</li>
        <li>Optionally, hide the small plastic baby inside the cake from the bottom before serving.</li>
      </ol>
