Introduction: The point of this project is to have a spin on a classic game. In my Earth, Wind, & Fire project, I create my own take of Rock, Paper, Scissors. 
Features: The game utilizes a basic rock, paper, scissors rule where:
•	“Earth takes out Fire"
•	"Wind blows away Earth"
•	"Fire consumes Wind"

Technologies: Use a button to choose an element: Earth, Wind, or Fire.
